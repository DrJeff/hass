== Home Assistant, Tasmota, AppDaemon configuration 

**Everything has a beginning  this is the beginning of
the beginning of this page**

=== Software Components

1. Home Assistant v87.1 - controler 
2. Tasmota - for IoT
3. AppDaemon 3.0.2 - for scripts 
4. InfluxDB/MySQL
5. Grafana 
6. BlueIris 
7. TasmotaAdmin
8. Yolo3 plugin for BlueIris -- object detection reduce false alarm to zero even in night 

=== Hardware Components

1. Intel z83
2. Almost any Tasmota hardware 
3. xiaomi mii- all of them 

=== Main components 

1. main home water consumption input /water leakage detector 
2. Air Conditioner automation  (Electra /Israel) 
3. Converting old PIMA Alarm + xiaomi mii sensros to be new smart alarm inspired by link:https://konnected.io/products/konnected-alarm-panel-wired-alarm-system-conversion-kit[konnected]
3.1 Tasmota/Wemo d1/i2c 16 gpio  
3.2 could scale with gpio/cheaper 
3.3 and Hey it uses Tasmota .. 

=== Home Assistant - custom components 

Used for defining Tasmota sensors/switch/binary sensors 

==== How to install 

Copy this project `<config directory>/custom_components/` folder to your `<config directory>`
make sure you are sync to the right version of hass (see below)

==== tasmota_counter 

Using this, you could define a sensor that saves Tasmota counter_id pulses info to none-volatile home assistance database. 
See discussion here link:https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/4681[4681]

[source,bash]
-------------------
  - platform: tasmota_counter
    name: water_total
    stopic: water_out    
    counter_id: 1        
    max_valid_diff: 2000 
    unit_of_measurement: 'l' 
    icon: mdi:water-pump
    expire_after: 300 
    value_template: "{{ (45497 + (value))|int }}"
-------------------

*stopic*: the short topic. for example the full topic will be tele/*stopic*/SENSOR 
*counter_id*: the id of the counter 1..4
*max_valid_diff*:  maximum difference in 60 sec
